# Part 9

This part is all about TypeScript: an open-source typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that compiles to plain JavaScript.

In this part, we will be using the tools previously introduced to build end-to-end features to an existing ecosystem with linters predefined and an existing codebase writing TypeScript. After doing this part, you should be able to understand, develop and configure projects using TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software and resources:

- Node.js
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   :
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ViksyAsenov/fullstackopen
     ```

2. **Navigate to the project directories:**
   :
     ```
     cd part9/patientor-backend
     cd part9/patientor-frontend
     ```

3. **Install the required dependencies for each directory:**
   :
     ```
     npm install
     ```


## Running the Application

To start the application, first run ```npm run tsc``` in the backend directory, after that run ```npm run build``` for the frontend directory. The last step is to run ```npm start``` in both directories.

You can then access the backend on: http://localhost:3001/. The frontend can be accessed on http://localhost:5173/
