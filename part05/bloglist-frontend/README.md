# Part 5

In this exercise, we will now create a frontend for the bloglist backend we created in the last part. A login functionnality is also implemented for restricting the possibility to view and create blogs only by authenticated users. We assume that a user already exists with the good credentials.

Since the objective of this part is to test the react app, unit tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests with cypress are also implemented.

## Requirements
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


## Start the application

To start the application :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViksyAsenov/fullstackopen
cd bloglist-frontend

# Download packages
npm install

# Start the application
npm start
```

You can then access the frontend on : [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
