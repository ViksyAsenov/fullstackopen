# Part 13

In this part, we will learn about using relational databases with Node.js applications. While previous sections of the course focused on MongoDB, a NoSQL database, this part will dive into PostgreSQL, the leading open-source relational database. We'll explore how relational databases have evolved, addressing scalability issues and adopting features from NoSQL databases.

We'll focus on creating and managing a Node.js application that utilizes PostgreSQL, examining its features and benefits for web development.
